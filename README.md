# Analyzing Images to get Readings from Seven Segment Display

Using the method from [pyimagesearch](https://pyimagesearch.com/2017/02/13/recognizing-digits-with-opencv-and-python/) by Adrian Rosebrock using OpenCV techniques to recognize values from a 7 segment display, I have added a method for recognizing 1 also properly, after the recognition the values can be saved to a excel sheet and plotted for visualization.

Here the images are from a multimeter reading current drawn by a Quadrotor during operation.
